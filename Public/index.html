            Alright, buckle up buckaroos, 'cause we got ourselves a wild ride here. This website is a chaotic playground of satirical shenanigans. Now listen up, folks, 'cause what you're about to witness is a mind-melting blend of edgy and cringe that'll leave you questioning your sanity. Everything you stumble upon here is as fictional as a unicorn in a cowboy hat, so don't go losing your marbles when you spot some eerily coincidental resemblances to reality. This is all part of the cosmic circus, where reality takes a backseat and satire takes the wheel. So strap in tight and get ready for a bumpy, mind-bending trip into the abyss of hilarity. Yeehaw!

            Hey kid named finger, if thats your real name. Congratulations on passing the Ohio state bar. You're the greatest legal mind I've ever known.

He – he covered his tracks, he got that idiot at the copy shop to lie for him. You think this is something? You think this is bad? This? This chicanery? He's done worse. That billboard! Are you telling me that a man just happens to fall like that? No! He orchestrated it! Jimmy! He defecated through a sunroof! And I saved him! And I shouldn't have. I took him into my own firm! What was I thinking? He'll never change. He'll never change! Ever since he was 9, always the same! Couldn't keep his hands out of the cash drawer! But not our Jimmy! Couldn't be precious Jimmy! Stealing them blind! And he gets to be a lawyer!? What a sick joke! I should've stopped him when I had the chance! And you – you have to stop him! You-
