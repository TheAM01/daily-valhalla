            Alright, buckle up buckaroos, 'cause we got ourselves a wild ride here. This website is a chaotic playground of satirical shenanigans. Now listen up, folks, 'cause what you're about to witness is a mind-melting blend of edgy and cringe that'll leave you questioning your sanity. Everything you stumble upon here is as fictional as a unicorn in a cowboy hat, so don't go losing your marbles when you spot some eerily coincidental resemblances to reality.

What was I thinking? He'll never change. He'll never change! Ever since he was 9, always the same! Couldn't keep his hands out of the cash drawer! But not our Jimmy! Couldn't be precious Jimmy! Stealing them blind! And he gets to be a lawyer!? What a sick joke! I should've stopped him when I had the chance! And you – you have to stop him! You-
